# Minecaft Clone
This is a project just for fun to learn 3d rendering, c++ and vulkan.

## Overview
Currently its just creating a World with basic perlin noise terrain generation.
I will add new things like: better terrain generation, trees, caves, water etc...

Some things that need to be changed:
- Destroy all vulkan correctly
- Use multiple uniform buffers for more render distance
- Give chunks that are far away less resolution
